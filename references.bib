  abstract = {Univalent homotopy type theory (HoTT) may be seen as a language for the category of $\infty$-groupoids. It is being developed as a new foundation for mathematics and as an internal language for (elementary) higher toposes. We develop the theory of factorization systems, reflective subuniverses, and modalities in homotopy type theory, including their construction using a "localization" higher inductive type. This produces in particular the ($n$-connected, $n$-truncated) factorization system as well as internal presentations of subtoposes, through lex modalities. We also develop the semantics of these constructions.},

  abstract = {We combine Homotopy Type Theory with axiomatic cohesion, expressing the latter internally with a version of "adjoint logic" in which the discretization and codiscretization modalities are characterized using a judgmental formalism of "crisp variables". This yields type theories that we call "spatial" and "cohesive", in which the types can be viewed as having independent topological and homotopical structure. These type theories can then be used to study formally the process by which topology gives rise to homotopy theory (the "fundamental $\infty$-groupoid" or "shape"), disentangling the "identifications" of Homotopy Type Theory from the "continuous paths" of topology. In a further refinement called "real-cohesion", the shape is determined by continuous maps from the real numbers, as in classical algebraic topology. This enables us to reproduce formally some of the classical applications of homotopy theory to topology. As an example, we prove Brouwer's fixed-point theorem.},

  abstract = {Working in homotopy type theory, we describe path spaces of pushouts as sequential colimits of pushouts. This gives a higher Seifert--van Kampen theorem. We demonstrate the utility of this description by showing that any pushout of 0-types is a 1-type, settling a long-standing open question in homotopy type theory. Our construction can be interpreted in any higher category with pullbacks, finite colimits satisfying descent, and sequential colimits.},

  abstract = {Given a span of spaces, one can form the homotopy pushout and then take the homotopy pullback of the resulting cospan. We give a concrete description of this pullback as the colimit of a sequence of approximations, using what we call the zigzag construction. We also obtain a description of loop spaces of homotopy pushouts. Using the zigzag construction, we reproduce generalisations of the Blakers-Massey theorem and fundamental results from Bass-Serre theory. We also describe the loop space of a wedge and show that it splits after suspension. Our construction can be interpreted in a large class of $(\infty,1)$-categories and in homotopy type theory, where it resolves the long-standing open problem of showing that a pushout of 0-types is 1-truncated. The zigzag construction is closely related to the James construction, but works in greater generality.},
