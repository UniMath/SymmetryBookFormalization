# Crisp types

## Idea

A {{#concept "crisp type"}} is a type whose formation is done in a purely _crisp
context_. In Agda, we can assume a variable type `A` is crisp by writing
`@â™­ A : UU`. Crisp types stand in contrast to {{#concept "cohesive types"}}
which are types that may be formed in arbitrary contexts.

**Note:** The notion of being a crisp type is quite different to that of being
[crisply flat discrete](modal-type-theory.flat-discrete-crisp-types.md).
Essentially, a crisply flat discrete type is a type whose _elements_ may be
assumed to be crisp. \[Remark 6.13, Shu15\]
