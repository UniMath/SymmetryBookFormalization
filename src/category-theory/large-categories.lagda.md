## Idea

A large category in Homotopy Type Theory is a large precategory for which the
identities between the objects are the isomorphisms. More specifically, an
equality between objects gives rise to an isomorphism between them, by the
J-rule. A large precategory is a large category if this function is an
equivalence. Note: being a large category is a proposition since `is-equiv` is a
proposition.

## Definition

```agda
is-category-Large-Precategory :
  {α : Level → Level} {β : Level → Level → Level} →
  (C : Large-Precategory α β) → UUω
is-category-Large-Precategory C =
  {l : Level} (X Y : obj-Large-Precategory C l) →
  is-equiv (iso-eq-Large-Precategory C X Y)

record
  Large-Category (α : Level → Level) (β : Level → Level → Level) : UUω
