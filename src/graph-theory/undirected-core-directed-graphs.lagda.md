## Idea

The **undirected core** of a [directed graph](graph-theory.directed-graphs.md)
`G` is the universal [undirected graph](graph-theory.undirected-graphs.md)
`undirected-core G` equipped with a
[morphism of directed graphs](graph-theory.morphisms-directed-graphs.md)

```text
  undirected-core G → G.
```

## Definitions

### The undirected core of a directed graph

```agda
module _
  {l1 l2 : Level} (G : Directed-Graph l1 l2)
  where

  vertex-undirected-core-Directed-Graph : UU l1
  vertex-undirected-core-Directed-Graph = vertex-Directed-Graph G

  edge-undirected-core-Directed-Graph :
    Symmetric-Relation l2 vertex-undirected-core-Directed-Graph
  edge-undirected-core-Directed-Graph =
    symmetric-core-Relation (edge-Directed-Graph G)

  undirected-core-Directed-Graph : Undirected-Graph l1 l2
  pr1 undirected-core-Directed-Graph = vertex-undirected-core-Directed-Graph
  pr2 undirected-core-Directed-Graph = edge-undirected-core-Directed-Graph
```

### The counit of the undirected core of a directed graph

```agda
module _
  {l1 l2 : Level} (G : Directed-Graph l1 l2)
  where

  vertex-counit-undirected-core-Directed-Graph :
    vertex-undirected-core-Directed-Graph G → vertex-Directed-Graph G
  vertex-counit-undirected-core-Directed-Graph = id

  edge-counit-undirected-core-Directed-Graph :
    {x y : vertex-Directed-Graph G} →
    edge-graph-Undirected-Graph (undirected-core-Directed-Graph G) x y →
    edge-Directed-Graph G x y
  edge-counit-undirected-core-Directed-Graph =
    counit-symmetric-core-Relation (edge-Directed-Graph G)

  counit-undirected-core-Directed-Graph :
    hom-Directed-Graph
      ( graph-Undirected-Graph (undirected-core-Directed-Graph G))
      ( G)
  pr1 counit-undirected-core-Directed-Graph =
    vertex-counit-undirected-core-Directed-Graph
  pr2 counit-undirected-core-Directed-Graph x y =
    edge-counit-undirected-core-Directed-Graph
