## Idea

An **undirected graph** consists of a type `V` of **vertices** and a
[symmetric binary relation](foundation.symmetric-binary-relations.md) `E` edges.

Note that in `agda-unimath`, symmetric binary relations on a type `V` are
families of types over the [unordered pairs](foundation.unordered-pairs.md) of
`V`. In other words, the edge relation of an undirected graph is assumed to be
fully coherently symmetric. Furthermore, there may be multiple edges between
vertices in an undirected graph, and undirected graphs may contain loops, i.e.,
edges from a vertex to itself.
