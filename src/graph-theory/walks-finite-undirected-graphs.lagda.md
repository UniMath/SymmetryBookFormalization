## Idea

A **walk** in a
[finite undirected graph](graph-theory.finite-undirected-graphs.md) `G` is
simply a [walk](graph-theory.walks-undirected-graphs.md) in its underlying
[undirected graph](graph-theory.undirected-graphs.md).

Note that the type of walks in a finite undirected graph does not need to be
[finite](univalent-combinatorics.finite-types.md), since edges can be repeated
in walks. However, the type of walks from `x` to `y` in a finite undirected
graph has [decidable equality](foundation.decidable-equality.md), and the type
of walks of a given length `n` in a finite undirected graph is finite.
