## Idea

A **connected set bundle** overt the
[circle](synthetic-homotopy-theory.circle.md) is a family of sets `X : 𝕊¹ → Set`
such that the total space `Σ 𝕊¹ (type-Set ∘ X)` is
[connected](foundation.connected-types.md). The connected set bundles over the
circle form a [large category](category-theory.large-categories.md), which can
be thought of as the categorification of the [poset](order-theory.posets.md) of
[natural numbers ordered by divisibility](elementary-number-theory.poset-of-natural-numbers-ordered-by-divisibilty.md).
