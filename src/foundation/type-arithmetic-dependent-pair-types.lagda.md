title: Type arithmetic for dependent pair types
---

```agda
{-# OPTIONS --without-K --exact-split #-}

module foundation.type-arithmetic-dependent-pair-types where

open import foundation-core.type-arithmetic-dependent-pair-types public
```

## Idea

We prove laws for the manipulation dependent pair types with respect to itself. The arithmetical laws involving cartesian product types, coproduct types, the unit type, and the empty type are proven in

```md
type-arithmetic-cartesian-products
type-arithmetic-coproducts
type-arithmetic-unit-type
type-arithmetic-empty-type
