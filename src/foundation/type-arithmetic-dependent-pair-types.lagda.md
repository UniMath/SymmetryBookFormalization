title: Type arithmetic for dependent pair types
---

```agda
module foundation.type-arithmetic-dependent-pair-types where

open import foundation-core.type-arithmetic-dependent-pair-types public
```

## Idea

We prove laws for the manipulation of dependent pair types with respect to themselves and contractible types.
