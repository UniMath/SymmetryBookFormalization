# Rewriting

module reflection.rewriting where

```agda
open import foundation-core.identity-types

## Idea

Agda's rewriting functionality allows us to add new strict equalities to our
type theory. Given an [identification](foundation-core.identity-types.md)
`β : x ＝ y`, then adding a rewrite rule for `β` with

```text
{-# REWRITE β #-}
```

will make it so `x` rewrites to `y`, i.e., `x ≐ y`.

**Warning.** Rewriting is by nature a very unsafe tool so we advice exercising
abundant caution when defining such rules.

## Definitions

We declare to Agda that the
[standard identity relation](foundation.identity-types.md) may be used to define
rewrite rules.

```agda
{-# BUILTIN REWRITE _＝_ #-}
```
