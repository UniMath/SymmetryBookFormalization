## 3. Sequences and Sequential Colimits

Definition 3.1: Sequences. We call sequences _sequential diagrams_.

```agda
import synthetic-homotopy-theory.sequential-diagrams using
  ( sequential-diagram)
```

Definition 3.2: Sequential colimits and their induction and recursion
principles, given by the dependent and non-dependent universal properties,
respectively. Our homotopies in the definitions of cocones go from left to
right, instead of right to left.

```agda
import synthetic-homotopy-theory.sequential-colimits using
  ( standard-sequential-colimit ;
    map-cocone-standard-sequential-colimit ;
    coherence-cocone-standard-sequential-colimit ;
    dup-standard-sequential-colimit ;
    up-standard-sequential-colimit)
```

Lemma 3.3: Uniqueness property of the sequential colimit.

```agda
import synthetic-homotopy-theory.sequential-colimits using
  ( equiv-htpy-htpy-out-of-standard-sequential-colimit ;
    htpy-htpy-out-of-standard-sequential-colimit)
```

Definition 3.4: Natural transformations and natural equivalences between
sequential diagrams. We call natural transformations _morphisms of sequential
diagrams_.

```agda
import synthetic-homotopy-theory.morphisms-sequential-diagrams using
  ( hom-sequential-diagram ;
    id-hom-sequential-diagram ;
    comp-hom-sequential-diagram)
import synthetic-homotopy-theory.equivalences-sequential-diagrams using
  ( equiv-sequential-diagram)
```

Lemma 3.5: Functoriality of the Sequential Colimit.

```agda
import synthetic-homotopy-theory.functoriality-sequential-colimits using
  ( map-hom-standard-sequential-colimit ; -- 1)
    preserves-id-map-hom-standard-sequential-colimit ; -- 2
    preserves-comp-map-hom-standard-sequential-colimit ; -- 3
    htpy-map-hom-standard-sequential-colimit-htpy-hom-sequential-diagram ; -- 4
    equiv-equiv-standard-sequential-colimit) -- 5
```

Lemma 3.6: Dropping a head of a sequential diagram preserves the sequential
colimit.

```agda
import synthetic-homotopy-theory.shifts-sequential-diagrams using
  ( up-cocone-shift-sequential-diagram ;
    compute-sequential-colimit-shift-sequential-diagram) -- apply to 1
```

Lemma 3.7: Dropping finitely many objects from the head of a sequential diagram
preserves the sequential colimit.

```agda
import synthetic-homotopy-theory.shifts-sequential-diagrams using
  ( compute-sequential-colimit-shift-sequential-diagram)
```

## 4. Fibered Sequences

Definition 4.1: Fibered sequences. In agda-unimath, a "sequence fibered over a
sequence (A, a)" is called a "dependent sequential diagram over (A, a)", and it
is defined in its curried form: instead of `B : Œ£ (n : ‚Ñï) A(n) ‚Üí ùí∞`, we use
`B : (n : N) ‚Üí A(n) ‚Üí ùí∞`.

Definition 4.3: Total sequential diagram of a dependent sequential diagram.

  ( total-sequential-diagram ;
    pr1-total-sequential-diagram)
```

TODO: Decide how to treat (C‚àû, c‚àû).
