## Idea

In [`structured-types.h-spaces`](structured-types.h-spaces.md) we saw that the
type of H-space structures on a
[pointed type](structured-types.pointed-types.md) `A` is equivalently described
as the type of [pointed sections](structured-types.pointed-types.md) of the
pointed evaluation map `(A → A) →∗ A`. If the type `A` is
[0-connected](foundation.0-connected-types.md), then the section maps to the
[connected component](foundation.connected-components.md) of `(A ≃ A)` at the
identity [equivalence](foundation-core.equivalences.md). Now the question arises
for which H-spaces this evaluation map `(A → A) →∗ A` is an equivalence. This
leads to the concept of _central H-space_.

A {{#concept "central pointed type" agda=Central-Pointed-Type}} is a
[pointed type](structured-types.pointed-types.md) such that the map
`ev_pt : (A → A)_{(id)} → A` from the connected component of the identity
function is an equivalence. Note that every type of [mere identity endomorphisms](foundation.mere-identity-endomorphisms.md) is an H-space, and therefore it follows that every central pointed type is also an H-space.

## Definitions

### The predicate of being a central pointed type

```agda
is-central-Pointed-Type :
  {l : Level} (A : Pointed-Type l) → UU l
is-central-Pointed-Type A =
  is-equiv
    { A = mere-identity-endomorphism (type-Pointed-Type A)}
    ( ev-point-Pointed-Type A ∘ pr1)
